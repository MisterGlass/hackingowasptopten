Sensitive data exposure

Official Definition: Many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data, such as credit cards, tax IDs, and authentication credentials. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser. 

Simple Definition: You just left this lying around where anyone could find it.

Hacker definition: Find some stuff that should be encrypted but wasn't (EG plaintext passwords), or something just left out in the open (EG sensitive database backups left on file servers). Profit.
