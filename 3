XSS

Official Definition: XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

Simple Definition: You let me run my javascript on your webpage.

Hacker definition: Find a way to post your own content to a page (EG comments) or a URL that reflects part of itself into the page (EG search) that isn't sanitized. Add your own JS payload. Profit.

Incident: Nice hack using filenames, even pinterest post titles that contain injected xss http://blog.detectify.com/post/39209711597/how-i-got-a-3-500-usd-facebook-bug-bounty

Demo: JS code injection - BEEF http://beefproject.com/ - Maybe pop a shell?

Fix: HTML encode &/or Escape your output, be careful where you output user submitted data
