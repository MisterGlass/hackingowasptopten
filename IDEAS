Real, weaponized hacks. No popping alert pages or sending users to evil.php .

Start with modified TOOOL "I will not pick locks that I do not explicitly have permission to pick" card.

Add a small target time to the slide (maybe on the speaker view only?) to aid with pacing. Maybe add current clock as well.

Proposed order:

4 ?
