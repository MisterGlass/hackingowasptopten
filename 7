Missing Function level Access Control

Official Definition: Most web applications verify function level access rights before making that functionality visible in the UI. However, applications need to perform the same access control checks on the server when each function is accessed. If requests are not verified, attackers will be able to forge requests in order to access functionality without proper authorization. 

Simple Definition: Someone confused UX with security

Hacker definition: Find an admin endpoint/url that isn't secured, just hidden (EG secured by obscurity). Hit it without bothering to authenticate. Profit.

Incident: ?

Demo: Exploit a "hidden" link that doesnt authenticate

Fix: ?


TODO: Very similar to 4. How is this different? What is the distinction?
