CSRF

Official Definition: A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.

Simple Definition: You took a request as a command instead of validating that is was a real command from a user.

Hacker definition: Find a url on a third party you want them to hit (EG "add to cart"). Find a way to send a request from a users browser (EG external image embed). Use url A as payload for request B. Profit.

Incident: (I remember something with amazon affiliates) ?

Demo: Enable admin privileges for a user (scenario: admin reviews blog comment with CSRF, makes my user super)? Maybe purchase an item from a shopping cart?

Fix: Properly implemened csrf tokens help, not perfect
