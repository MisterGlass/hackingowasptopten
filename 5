Security misconfiguration

Official Definition: Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web server, database server, and platform. Secure settings should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure. Additionally, software should be kept up to date. 

Simple Definition: You screwed up your deployment.

Hacker definition: Find a misconfigured site (EG default pass, debug enabled). Leverage for easy pwnage. Profit.
