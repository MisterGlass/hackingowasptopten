Broken Authentication/Session management

Official Definition: Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other usersâ€™ identities.

Simple Definition: Authentication & sessions are a primary target, and you screwed them up.

Hacker definition: Find a problem with the session code (EG, exposed session ID). Leverage to gain access as user. Profit.

Incident: Firesheep was bad session, "naked celeb hacker" was bad authentication (https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Apple+iCloud+Security+Incident/18605)

Demo: Cookie/session hijacking, possibly changing users by changing nonrandom session id

Fix: ?
