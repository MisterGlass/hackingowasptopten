Insecure Direct Object Reference

Official Definition: A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.

Simple Definition: You forgot to lock a page.

Hacker definition: Find a reference to an entity/object/whatever (EG account ID). Change it. Profit.
