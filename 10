Unvalidated redirects

Official Definition: Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages.

Simple Definition: Users trusted you, went to your website. You forwarded your users to a website without checking it right. That website can do bad thigns to your users.

Hacker definition: Find a trusted site (EG facebook) with a page that will redirect to a page of your choice. Use it to redirect unsuspecting users to bad pages. Profit.
