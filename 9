Components with known vulnerabilities

Official Definition: Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts.

Simple Definition: You used someone elses insecure stuff.

Hacker definition: Find a site using a library with a know vulnerability. Exploit known vulnerability. Profit.
