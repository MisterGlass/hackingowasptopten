Injection

Official Definition: Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization. 

Simple Definition: You ran someones input as code.

Hacker definition: Find a place where the dev executes your input. Put hack code into input. Profit.

Incident: ? Bobby tables? something bigger? This guy found injection in flicker and leveraged it all the way to reading server files and code execution http://pwnrules.com/flickr-from-sql-injection-to-rce/
