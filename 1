Injection

Official Definition: Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization. 

Simple Definition: Someone gave you input, which you stupidly put into a command thinking it was just data.

Hacker definition: Find a place where the dev executes your input. Put hack code into input. Profit.

Incident: ? Bobby tables? something bigger?

Demo: Quick how to? Blind sql injection?

Fix: Parameterized query input, stored procedures, application whitelisting
